## Project Description
Our project focuses on creating a user-friendly interface for interacting with Gnosis Safe contracts. Here are some key features and functionalities:

1. **Gnosis Safe Dashboard**: Our dashboard provides an intuitive interface for users to manage their Gnosis Safe accounts. Users can view their account details, transaction history, and other relevant information.

2. **Transaction Management**: Users can initiate, review, and approve transactions directly from the dashboard. This feature streamlines the transaction process and enhances user control over their funds.

3. **Contract Deployment**: We facilitate seamless contract deployment for Gnosis Safe accounts. Users can deploy new contracts and manage existing ones with ease.

4. **Auto Liquidity Management**: Our project includes a tool to automatically manage user liquidity, providing an alternative to traditional staking yields.
